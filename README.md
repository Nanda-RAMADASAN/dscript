# Simple AES Encryption/Decryption Script

## Overview
This JavaScript script provides a simple way to encrypt and decrypt text using AES-GCM algorithm. It's designed to run in the browser's console and uses the Web Crypto API for cryptographic operations.

## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt text using AES-GCM.
- Uses SHA-256 hash of a user-provided key string for encryption and decryption.
- Simple and interactive user prompts for inputs and operations.

## Usage
To use this script, simply copy and paste it into your browser's console. Follow the prompts to enter your private key, select the action (encrypt or decrypt), and input the text accordingly.

### Steps:
1. Enter your private key string when prompted.
2. Choose whether to encrypt (C) or decrypt (D) text.
3. Enter the text you wish to encrypt or the encrypted text you wish to decrypt.

## Note
This script is intended for educational and demonstration purposes. It's not recommended for production-level encryption/decryption due to the potential security implications.
